# Trip Planner & ELD Logger

## Description
Trip Planner & ELD Logger is a full-stack web application that enables property-carrying truck drivers to plan trips efficiently and maintain compliant Electronic Logging Device (ELD) records. The app accepts trip details, calculates routes, visualizes them on a map, and generates daily log sheets that follow Hours-of-Service (HOS) regulations.

The application was developed as part of a Full Stack Developer assessment and is live-hosted with a Loom walkthrough and public GitHub repository.

## Features
- **User Input**
  - Current location (optional)
  - Pickup location (dropdown from predefined options)
  - Dropoff location (required; dropdown)
  - Hours used in current 70-hour/8-day cycle
- **Route Visualization**
  - Map displays route from pickup to dropoff
  - Includes rest stops and fuel breaks (approx. every 1,000 miles)
  - Uses OpenRouteService API for mapping and geocoding
- **ELD Logs**
  - Auto-generates daily ELD log sheets
  - Compliant with US DOT property-carrying HOS regulations
  - Visual representation of drive time, rest time, and duty status
- **Dropdown for Known Stops**
  - Reduces API call failures by allowing users to select from a list of known depots in Gauteng

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React (Vite), Bootstrap, JavaScript (Fetch API)
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite (development), MySQL (production-ready)
- **Other Services**: OpenRouteService API (maps), Vercel (hosting), Loom (video demo)

## Installation

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trip-eld-logger.git
cd trip-eld-logger
```

### Backend Setup (Django)
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### Frontend Setup (React)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Access the app at http://localhost:5173

## Usage
1. Navigate to the trip planner form.
2. Select or enter your current, pickup, and dropoff locations.
3. Enter the hours already used in your current cycle (e.g., 14).
4. Submit to receive a map route and dynamically generated ELD log sheets.
5. Review each day's log sheet to ensure DOT compliance.

## To-Do
- Implement Google Places or Mapbox Autocomplete
- Enable PDF export of daily log sheets
- Add user accounts and trip history
- Include distance and estimated time on the route display
- Improve mobile responsiveness

## Assumptions
- 70 hours over 8 days driving limit (property-carrying)
- 11-hour daily driving cap
- 1 hour allotted each for pickup and dropoff
- Fueling required every 1,000 miles
- No adverse driving conditions considered
