# Trip Planner & ELD Logger

## Description
Trip Planner & ELD Logger is a full-stack web application that enables property-carrying truck drivers to plan trips efficiently and maintain compliant Electronic Logging Device (ELD) records. The app accepts trip details, calculates routes, visualizes them on a map, and generates daily log sheets that follow Hours-of-Service (HOS) regulations.

The application was developed as part of a Full Stack Developer assessment and is live-hosted with a Loom walkthrough and public GitHub repository.

## Features
- **User Input**
  - Current location (optional)
  - Pickup location (dropdown from predefined options)
  - Dropoff location (required; dropdown)
  - Hours used in current 70-hour/8-day cycle
- **Route Visualization**
  - Map displays route from pickup to dropoff
  - Includes rest stops and fuel breaks (approx. every 1,000 miles)
  - Uses OpenRouteService API for mapping and geocoding
- **ELD Logs**
  - Auto-generates daily ELD log sheets
  - Compliant with US DOT property-carrying HOS regulations
  - Visual representation of drive time, rest time, and duty status
- **Dropdown for Known Stops**
  - Reduces API call failures by allowing users to select from a list of known depots in Gauteng

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React (Vite), Bootstrap, JavaScript (Fetch API)
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite (development), MySQL (production-ready)
- **Other Services**: OpenRouteService API (maps), Vercel (hosting), Loom (video demo)
